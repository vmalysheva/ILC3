 - ILC3s PCHi-C data analysis
 - comparison with previously published data (Javierre et al.)
 - comparison with public annotations (BLUEPRINT)
 - CHiCAGO vs ABC comparison
 - Epigenetic/TFs binding/PCHi-C/GWAS plots

### [`./LOLA`](../LOLA)
The `./LOLA` directory contains a script for running LOLA, checking enrichment of promoter-interacting regions for TF binding sites.

More udpates coming shortly.
